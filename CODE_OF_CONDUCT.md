# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, accommodating and a positive environment, we, as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
community a harassment-free experience for everyone- regardless of age, appearance,
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Behaviour that helps to fulfill our pledge includes:

- Respect the purpose and objective of the community.
- Using sensitized and inclusive language
- Being respectful to differing viewpoints, thoughts and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focussing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Instances of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling/insulting/any kind of harassment(felt by the individual), passing derogatory remarks.
- Open personal and/or political attacks
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other behaviour which could be considered reasonably inappropriate in a
  professional setting(disregarded by majority in the community)

## Our Responsibilities

Project managers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project managers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not alligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for some behaviour which they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces as well as in public spaces
where an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
such instances include using an official project e-mail address,
posting via official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or an offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project managers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting the project team at faisal_manzer@yahoo.in. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate according to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project managers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face necessary repercussions as determined by other
members who are a part of the project's leadership.
